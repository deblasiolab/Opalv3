Quick-start
-----------

To form an alignment of multiple input sequences, run:
   java -jar Opal.jar --in infile.fasta --out outfile
or
   java -jar Opal.jar infile.fasta > outfile


To align two fixed alignments, run:
   java -jar Opal.x.jar --in alignment1.fasta --in2 alignment2.fasta


If you receive an "out of memory" error message, increase the memory 
allocated to the Java VM like this:
   java -Xmx1G -jar Opal.jar --in infile.fasta --out outfile
(this example give 1GB of RAM to Opal)

Common arguments (optional)
---------------------------

--in filename 
    Specify file (fasta format) containing the unaligned sequences
    that Opal is to align.
--in2 filename 
    With this option, an alignment of two alignments is performed. 
    The two files specified in \"--in\" and \"--in2\" must 
    both contain alignments, and be in fasta format.
--out filename 
    Specify the name of the file that Opal should write the 
    alignment to. Default is to print to STDOUT
--out_format [fasta|clustalw] 
    Default = fasta		
--align_method [exact|profile|mixed] 
    Default = mixed
	Alignment method used in building initial alignment 
	(before polishing)
    	* Exact method shows slightly better recovery of benchmarks.
		* Profile is much faster for large inputs.
		* Mixed method performs exact (slower) alignment on small 
		subproblems, and profile (faster) alignment on larger 
		subproblems.
--polish_align_method  [exact|profile|mixed]
    Default = value of align_method
    Alignment method used when performing post-polishing step
    See --align_method
--polish [exhaust_twocut|random_twocut|random_tree_twocut|random_threecut]
    Default = random_tree_twocut
    See ISMB paper for details
--polish_reps n 
    Default depends on alignment method and number of input sequences
--gamma n 
    Gap open penalty. 
    Defaults: Amino acid = 60; Nucleotide = 280.
--lambda n 
    Gap extension penalty. 
    Defaults: Amino acid = 38; Nucleotide = 66.
--gamma_term n 
    Open penalty for terminal gaps. 
    Defaults: Amino acid = 15; Nucleotide = 280. 
--lambda_term n 
    Extension penalty for terminal gaps. 
    Defaults: Amino acid = 36; Nucleotide = 66.
--treein
    Name of file containing the merge tree (in Newick format)  
--treeout
    Name of file to which Opal should write the merge tree 
    it calculates (in Newick format)
--just_tree
    Just build the merge tree, then quit (no alignment)
--quiet 
    Restrict status updates printed to STDERR
--distance_type  [kmer_normcost|normcost|pctid]
    Default = kmer_normcost
    pctid calculates a distance for each pair of sequences by 
        aligning the pair, then calculating the percent of all
        non-gap columns that are identical under a compressed 
        alphabet; the merge tree is built based on these costs.
    normcost calculates a distance for each pair of sequences 
        based on normalized alignment cost (see Opal paper for
        details); the merge tree is built based on these costs. 
    kmer_normcost causes an initial merge tree to be built based 
        on pairwise kmer counts (see MAFFT papers for basic 
        approach). With this tree, an initial mulitple alignment 
        is formed, and new pairwise distances (based on 
        normalized cost) are calculated from the pairwise 
        alignments induced by that multiple alignment. A new 
        merge tree is formed based on those distances. This may be 
        repeated (see --tree_iterations)
--tree_iterations
    Default = 2 (if distance_type == kmer_normcost).
    Number of times to repeat construction of merge tree based
    on alignment in previous step. Value of 1 will just 
    build an alignment based on the initial merge tree
--input_order 
    Output sequences of alignment in the same order as in the 
    input file.  This is default behavior.
--tree_order
    Output sequences of alignment in an order that depends on 
    the merge tree.  Default is --input_order
--protein
    Opal attempts to guess the type of sequences that are to be
    aligned.  If no characters are found in the input that are 
    amino-acid-only (not a nucleotide ambiguity code), then Opal
    guesses DNA. This argument forces treatment as protein sequence.
